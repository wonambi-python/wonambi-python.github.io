Screenshot
==========

Simple raster screenshots can be taken using standard Screenshot programs in Windows or Linux.
However, if you want to save a vector image which can later be edited in Inkscape or Illustrator, you can click on:

.. image:: images/exportsvg_01.png

You can export either the traces (including time stamps, channel labels, annotations) or the overview to ``svg``, using the following menu:

.. image:: images/exportsvg_02.png
