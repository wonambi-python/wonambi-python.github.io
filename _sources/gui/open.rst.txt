Open Dataset
============

Start the graphical user interface with ``wonambi`` from the command line:

.. image:: images/open_01_start.png

To load a dataset, click on ``Open Dataset``:

.. image:: images/open_02_open_dataset.png

Select if it's a file or a directory, and select it in the file explorer. The name of the file will then appear in the panel ``Information`` -> ``Dataset`` -> ``Filename``. 
Then, create a new channel group by clicking on ``New`` in the ``Channels`` panel and give it a name (such as `scalp`, `eog`, `meg`):

.. image:: images/open_03_loaded.png

You'll get the list of channels in the dataset. 
If you want to edit the labels, see :ref:`edit-labels` .

.. image:: images/open_04_channel_new.png

Select the channels you want to plot and click on ``Apply``:
